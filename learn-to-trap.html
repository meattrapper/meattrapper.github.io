<p><script type="text/javascript" src="https://gumroad.com/js/gumroad-button.js"></script>This is a complete, no nonsense, straight talk Trapping 101 course. This is an hour long, no BS video that will take you from knowing nothing about trapping to being able to set traps and put food on your table.</p>
<p>This is not a slick, special effects heavy, professionally produced video.</p>

<p>This is a simple, homemade video that will teach you the basics of trapping. Most trapping videos sell for $40 these days. They have to cover the cost of expensive cameras, editors, dealers, middlemen and packaging and shipping. I cut through all the bull and extra cost and give you what you need to start catching animals, whether you&#8217;re trapping for fur, for meat or for survival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s nothing secret in this video. In fact, if you spend enough time online you can probably find everything in this video for free. The problem is, you&#8217;ll spend a lot of time doing it, and in the process you&#8217;ll run across a lot of inaccurate, incomplete and misleading information. For only $1.99, less than the cost of a gallon of gas, you&#8217;ll have everything you need to get started in one, simple, well organized, easy to understand video. What is covered in this video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why should you learn to trap?</li>
<li>What are the different types of traps?</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll cover coil spring traps, long spring traps, body grip traps and snares</li>
<li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of each type?</li>
<li>What size trap do you need to use?</li>
<li>What are &#8216;offset jaws&#8217; and when do you need to use them?</li>
<li>How to safely handle traps</li>
<li>How to fasten your trap down so the animal can&#8217;t run off with it after being caught</li>
<li>What are the different types of cable to make snares from and what is the difference between them?</li>
<li>What are the basic trapping tools you need</li>
<li>What is an extension cable and why you need them</li>

</ul>

</ul>
