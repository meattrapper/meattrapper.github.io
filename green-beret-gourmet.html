<h1>Green Beret Gourmet</h1>

<p>This highly sought after, impossible to obtain book is probably the most hardcore cook book ever published. After a long absence, it will be returning
soon! Stay tuned for updates!</p>

<p> This book was written by a Special Forces soldier who served in Vietnam. It's all here - the nitty gritty of how to prepare almost any
type of wild game, critter or insects. Tips on dynamite fishing, cooking rats, snakes - and some you'll just have to see for yourself.</p>
<p>

<p> The no holds barrred content is matched only by the one of a kind artwork that is sprinkled throughout the book. Trust me - this book is a highly sought after classic.
It's one that will not only entertain, it might just save your butt and fill your belly when things have gone belly up!</p>
